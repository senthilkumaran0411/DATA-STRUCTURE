import array

# Initialize the array with numbers 1 to 9 (array of integers 'i')
number = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Since arrays are fixed in data type, we can't append a string directly like 'raj'.
# To keep it similar, we'll convert the array back to a list, modify it, and convert it back to an array.

# Convert array to list
number_list = number.tolist()

# Append 'raj' and 'senthil' (though arrays can't directly store strings)
number_list.append('raj')  # Appending 'raj' to the end of the list
number_list.insert(0, 'senthil')  # Inserting 'senthil' at the start of the list

# Print the modified list
print(number_list)
